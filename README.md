# auction_voice

Build a voice-enabled agent that helps users participate in fast-paced online auctions in real time. The agent should inform users about auction items, current highest bids, and time left — all through voice. It must also allow users to place new bids by speaking, only if the bid is higher than the current one. The system should track each product's bidding history and support live updates of auction states.

✅ Features

Voice-based bidding (only higher bids allowed).
